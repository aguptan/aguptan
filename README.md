## Using AI in Coding
- **Breaking down complex problems & system design**
  - **Requirements → modules:** 
		- Turn problem statements into a module maps (data loaders, preprocessing, model/train loops, evaluation, logging) for architecture exploration.
  
  - **Architecture exploration:** 
		- Compare design options (e.g., LOOCV vs K-Fold, single vs multi-objective HPO, patient- vs electrode-level analysis) 
		- Draft pros/cons before implementation.
        - Produce stepwise build plans (prep → train → validate → analyze) to keep work scoped and reproducible.
		
- **Speeding up development**

- **Refinement**
  - **Speed**
  - **Refactoring** 
  - **Robustness** 

- **Aid with documentation**
